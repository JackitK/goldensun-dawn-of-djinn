VI.) Djinni Charms
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
1.0 Introduction
Djinni Charms are a new mechanic for Dawn of Djinn.  Throughout your adventure you see that various items have been changed from OG Golden Sun. Part of that includes various chests now containing a Djinni Charm.  Djinni Charms are Djinni in either a premature or weaken state. Djinn themselves are manifestations of pure Psynergy and Djinni Charms are the form many take before they fully awaken.  

While they are not ready to assist you to the same degree a of a normal Djinn, they can still assist you in battle.  If you equip a Djinn charm it'll take up your ring equipment slot, but grant you a slight resistance to their element.  In addition you can use their skill as Psynergy in battle adding additional customization to your characters beyond the usual class system.  However, as Djinn in the charm state has not fully awaken, they need assistance from Adepts to unleash their powers.  Because of this only an Adept of the same elemental alignment as the Djinn can equip them. For example Isaac is a Venus Adept, so a Venus Djinni Charm needs to be equipped to him in order to be usable in battle. Issac can equip Venus charms, Garret can equip Mars charms, Ivan can equip Jupiter charms, and Mia can equip Mercury charms. In additon, each Adept can have only one Djinni Charm equipped at a time, as it does take up an equipment slot.  

Being able to have only one at a time, you'll have to think about what abilites would be most useful to bring into each battle. Though the abilites are different enough that there's flexability on which ones to bring based on your battle style and the classes you decided to have for your party members.  Thankfully if your inventory gets too full, you can sell the charms and rebuy them at a cheap price to better manage your inventory.

2.0 Djinni Chests
